      <h1>Esper is Shutting Down</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Esper will shut down on October 13, 2017.</strong> If you use
        Esper for calendar analytics / charting,
        <a href="#export">see below for how to export your data</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After four years of trying to save people time, we’ve decided to shut
        down Esper. Esper started off as an executive assistant service focused
        on scheduling but later helped people manage meeting overload by
        charting how time was spent, creating meeting agendas, and collecting
        post-meeting ratings. Unfortunately, Esper has not seen the user growth
        or revenue needed to sustain the product, and we’ve decided to shut
        things down.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be canceling all subscriptions and refunding paying users on
        a prorated basis as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        After shutdown, all customer data will be deleted from our systems.
        This includes all calendar data, payment information, analytics data,
        and access tokens. We will not sell or provide customer data to any
        other companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're proud of all the work that everyone at Esper has put into the
        product over the years, and we regret not being to do more. We continue
        to believe that excessive and poorly planned meetings
        remain a very real problem for companies both large and small
        and believe that there is an opportunity (albeit a difficult one)
        for anyone who can solve this.

      <h2>Data Export</h2>
      <p>
        If you used Esper's individual charting product, you can
        <a href="/manage#!/team/export">export your event tagging
        data as a CSV file here</a>. If you had access to multiple Esper
        accounts (e.g. as an executive assistant), you will have to export
        your data for each account (click on each account in the left sidebar).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you used Esper for Enterprise,
        <a href="/groups#!/settings/default/misc">go here to export your
        data</a>. If you cannot access that page, please check with your
        team's administrator. If you were a member of multiple Enterprise
        teams, you will need to export data for each team separately
        (click on the dropdown in the header to switch teams).
