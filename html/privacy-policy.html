      <h2>What We Do with the Information We Gather</h2>
      <p>Except as set forth in Esper's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, Esper employees are prohibited from viewing the Customer Information and content created through Esper Products and Services. If you contact Esper for additional information or for help in resolving technical issues, Esper employees and associates may access relevant data in order to resolve your issue.</p>
      <p>In addition to using the Customer Information in connection with the Products and Services, Esper also uses Customer Information to understand your needs and to better tailor the Products and Services, to develop or improve future functionality of the Products and Services, and to customize the Esper website according to your preferences. Additionally, Esper may use the Customer Information for its own internal record keeping and product development. Esper may use the email contact information of persons contacted through the Products and Services for direct marketing purposes (except as may be prohibited under applicable law) unless you instruct Esper not to per the instructions under the "Contact Us" heading below.</p>
      <p>If you use the "Contact Us" link on the Esper website, Esper will use the information provided to contact you about the Products or Services. Esper may also contact you about your account or any of the Products or Services to which you subscribe.</p>
      <p>Esper may periodically send promotional emails, special offers or information about products which we think may be of interest to you. For example, Esper may contact you to further discuss your interest in the Products and Services and to send you information about Esper, its partners, its affiliates, and information about promotions or events. Additionally, Esper may also contact you for market research purposes. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of such promotional and market research communications.</p>
      <p>The Financial Information is used solely to assess the financial qualifications of potential users and to collect payments for the purchase of any Products and Services. Esper uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing on Esper's behalf.</p>
      <p>The Internet Gathered Information is used to operate and improve Esper's website, Products and Services. The Internet Gathered Information may also be used alone or in conjunction with Customer Information to provide you with personalized information about Esper Products and Services.</p>
      <p>We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to data processors who act on our behalf (service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our website and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose). To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose Customer Information in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety, protect the security or integrity of our website, save the world from impending asteroid strike, or enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
